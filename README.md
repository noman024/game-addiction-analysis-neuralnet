# Game Addiction Analysis with Neural Network (Deep Learning)
Created a neural network from scratch that can
predict whether a student can have a physical disorder (eyesight or hearing issue) due to game addiction. The model was
trained on a new dataset which was prepared based on some survey question-answer collected from different private universities
in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The model has achieved 80.70% of accuracy.
